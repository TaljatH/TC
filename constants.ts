I myself wish that I could do more, and I know I would do more if we lived with each other. I would have been taking you out for dinners, surprising you with breakfast, taking care of you... Or just anything to make you happy.\n\nSo I want to start with something I was working with in secret for few days now.\n\nI made a promise that I will love you no matter what. I will keep that promise until I die.`

    text: `You are cute,
and your kindness
is what makes me love you.

Your cute pout when you’re upset,
your angry face that’s still cute.

And when you look at me
with those eyes,
soft and in love,
the whole world goes quiet.

I just look back at you,
and I’m happy.`

is when we both feel free,
when we can be ourselves
and still love each other.

Your love feels like a warm hug,
it fills me up inside.

Your kindness shines so bright,
it makes me feel happy.`,
